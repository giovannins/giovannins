This is my website, and here you can find more info about me and things I do.

This site is more like an ultra-simple base portfolio that anyone can build, well, that's the overview. On my side it's more of a CSS challenge because I really think I need to improve my CSS code and a simple website can make a difference.

## no JS?
Yeah! This website is JavaScriptless, this means it contain no JavaScript in your inside, this is crazy for any front-end developer that want to values change in realtime.

### Why?
JavaScript is slow.

### Is this site from 1990?
No, it's from 2022. But I'm using the basics of building a site, such as. HTML5 and CSS3.
