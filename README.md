# Giovanni Neves Sadauscas

 Hi, I'm Giovanni Neves Sadauscas, 22 years old, and I'm a PHP programmer.
 
 I have a passion for open source software and systems. Yes, I use Linux (by the way, I used to use Arch! Now I use OpenSUSE).

 ## My website

  On my website I publish my setup, my portfolio and my blog posts.

  Some of this content describes my experiences and how I've evolved over that time, while other content just describes day-to-day happenings and what I've learned.

  you can access my website where [giovannins](https://giovannins.xyz).

## Why PHP?

  I choose PHP as my main language for its simplicity and my previous experiences with it. I have tried Java, Ruby, JavaScript, Emacs LISP? I think the only one I haven't tried is C Sharp.

  PHP fits where I want to perform. This makes me happy, happier to know about the community. Even knowing that javascript fans will tell me PHP is dying I know it is strong and holding its own.
