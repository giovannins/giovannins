</p>

<p class="p-2">
    First of all, what is "Laravel" you are asking yourself. look it up yourself! <br>
    I'm not here to explain everything, this is not a blog tutorial... I think... maybe, I don't know. In short, Laravel
    is a "full-stack framework" made to make developers' lives easier, sometimes... or not.
</p>

    Why do I want to share how I built and be super technical and logical to create this super ""Portfolio"" first of
    all?

    It's been a long time since I've used a framework like Laravel. Now I'm using NEXT JS in my work to build fullstack
    applications, after watching some YouTube videos about blogging and how great it can be to learn something new and
    store those lessons. I decide to create my own!
</p>

<p class="p-2">

    only this but, a challenge to who was been worked as PHP Developer and after long time
