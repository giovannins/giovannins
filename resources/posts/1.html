    Hello everyone. This is my blog, my website, my place on the world wide web. This is kind of a crazy thing.
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    Welcome, welcome to my first post about where! Today's post: "How I built my website with Laravel".
    First of all, what is "Laravel" you are asking yourself. look it up yourself!
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    I'm not here to explain everything, this is not a blog tutorial... I think... maybe, I don't know. In short, Laravel
    is a "full-stack framework" made to make developers' lives easier, sometimes... or not.
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    Why do I want to share how I built and be super technical and logical to create this super ""Portfolio"" first of
    all?
    <small>
        Am not.
    </small>
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    It's been a long time since I've used a framework like Laravel. Now I'm using NEXT JS in my work to build fullstack
    applications, after watching some YouTube videos about blogging and how great it can be to learn something new and
    store those lessons. I decide to create my own!
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    I choice Laravel because, PHP. I really like PHP and in a come future I really want to work full-time with it. not
    only this but, a challenge to who was been worked as PHP Developer and after long time and relearning Laravel.
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    I want to tell you how i build this, first of all I used the "Laracast" platform and the offical documentation of
    Laravel, everything is free, do not even need to login.
</p>

<h2 class="lg:text-4xl text-3xl lg:mt-6 mt-4">Getting started</h2>

<p class="p-2">
    First of all, I need to make a "Post class", it's like a template that will get all my posts from a folder. Yes
    folder! I'm using an HTML text to save all my posts and after that maybe I'll transfer them to a database, but
    Laracast taught that, so... that's what I'm using now.
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    When I was creating the Class I remember the old times, I created Classes, namespaces, encapsulation and much more.
    It's been a while since I created a Class, it was nostalgic
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    Speaking of the old days, oh God, how I suffered with "." and remember, oh I have to use "->" and where to go again
    review all the code to see where I was using it right, worst, the blade file uses the "."
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    For the front-end I use Blade and TailwindCSS to make my life easier to "write" CSS. along with Font Awesome icons
    to make that A+ on the front-end. I'm not a front-end developer, but I'm proud of what I've done here.
</p>

<p class="p-2">
    After doing design and styling the way I liked it, I decided to start looking into how to load the content into the
    HTML in Laravel, it was very simple to call the document. After this I need to Deploy.
</p>

<h2 class="lg:text-4xl text-3xl lg:mt-6 mt-4">Deploying</h2>

<p class="p-2">
    I host my site on shared hosting, as the "default host" on the internet, very simple. Who knows I have to link the
    "public" folder to "public_html" and when I found out it was like 2am.
</p>

<p class="p-2">

    After linking the folder I don't compile the CSS package, I need nodeJS on my server and where I pushed the host
    they don't make nodeJS available with PHP. It is only one, nodeJS or PHP. But, I am a Linux user and yes, I
    downloaded the binary to run nodeJS, it was wrong and kind of mean. It's worth it.
</p>

<h2 class="lg:text-4xl text-3xl lg:mt-6 mt-4">Ending</h2>

<p class="p-2">
    Well I guess that's it, I have nothing more to say about my development of this website/blog. Thank you for read my
    first article and bye!
