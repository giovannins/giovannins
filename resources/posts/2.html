    Hello everyone, today I'm gonna talk about “tutorial hell”. This is what all programmers will pass through one day,
    one week, even a month.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    Is not simple as “stop watch the tutorial, go programming”. Saying that way it is look simple What I am try to
    explain is how I first meeted tutorial hell and how I leaved it.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    First of all, what is “tutorial hell”? Is a conditional psychological phenomenon that happen when you, young
    programmer, is trying to learn a language or framework but keep stuck in videos tutorials and walk through for
    simpler projects. To-Do List, CRUD, Real-time chat and the worst of all… crash course!
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    Oh God, how I hate the crash course, it is useless, pointless, meaningless, without knowledge. It is literally you
    copy and paste documentation into google translate and press the text-to-speak button.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    Calm down, I know, there is good examples of crash course, I watch crash course in my life, I stay stuck at crash
    courser so much time then I regret to admit.
</p>

<h2 class="lg:text-4xl text-3xl lg:mt-6 mt-4">How I started in tutorial hell?</h2>

<p class="py-2">
    t is a simple question. with a lot of answers, witch one do you wanna listen? First start in tutorial hell, back
    2017 when I was trying to learn the Rails framework for back-end development. Of course, using Ruby because at the
    time I used to use a lot more of Ruby, god, I used for scripting on Linux. Puff who need Shell when I can use Ruby?
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    I was excited to learn how to use Rails. Famous websites and applications were built with it. GitHub, Airbnb, I
    don't know which ones anymore. If I made an application as good as many of these and shot into the sky like a
    rocket. My million dollar idea. <small>What a shame!</small>
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    The tutorial I was watching is one hour long. Of course I will learn everything about Rails, security, database,
    hosting, deployment, migrations, front-end, back-end and more in only one hour, who don't learn those things in one
    video? Yes I belive I will learn everything about Rails in one video, much innocent.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    I tried to start slowly, you know I don't want to hurt the Ruby on Rails framework with my learning power in one
    hour. Task list application time. Yes, I was trying to develop a simple "whole scaffold" and make some nice screens
    using bootstrap 5.0. This was the scope of the project. I got it.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    After two days of work, going through the video, watching and trying to play the video, I got it. It works like a
    copy and paste from GitHub, no joke, even the file names were the same. If you clone the two projects, the only
    difference is the Rails version and the creation date. But, I do not feel I learn something, I feel I just copy and
    paste what was in the video. I questing myself and try to proof wrong, try to proof I learn something and start a
    fresh project, and when I just opened the IDE…
</p>

<h2 class="lg:text-4xl text-3xl lg:mt-6 mt-4">Blank</h2>

<p class="py-2">
    Just blank, I can't even think of what I should start with first. Maybe the database, but if I'm wrong, start with
    the database? Maybe the templates, no, I need the template database. The answer might be Controllers, not
    Controllers. Views? Yes, I will start with the views. Done, what now. And this is how I feel. What now? I know it's
    incomplete, but I need a guide to tell me what I have to do now. Funny or not, I think the tutorial hell is more
    something about insecurity and fear of failure.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    I remember stay hours seen the IDE blank, with no idea, what next? What should I do? Am I on the right way? Fear.
    But I do not give up… well, from Ruby, yes, but not from programming. After two weeks of no progress I try PHP. Love
    at the first time? No. But it works! I already know about PHP but never try it for real.
</p>

<h2 class="lg:text-4xl text-3xl lg:mt-6 mt-4">I tryed it, for real</h2>

<p class="py-2">When I changed Ruby language to PHP I feel different, I do not know how describe but you feel. Like call
    a method using an arrow! This is awesome, it is so different, can only be good. <strong>OH GOD NO SESSION NO I CAN’T
        HOLD THIS ANYMORE DEBUG THIS ANYMORE HEEELLPP</strong>.
</p>

<h2 class="lg:text-4xl text-3xl lg:mt-6 mt-4">Was nice start programming in PHP.</h2>

<p class="py-2">
    I put in my head, if I need some help, any help, I will read the documentation. ONLY the documentation, oh God
    thanks I found my solution in Stackoverf… I mean <strong>DOCUMENTATION</strong>.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    This is crucial to create a good habit to read the documentation and not depend on tutorial videos, of course when I
    started I watched a video tutorial, I viewed a crash course, by the way, thank you professor Gustavo Guanabara from
    “Curso em Video” to start me on PHP development, if you need learn the basics and basic of OOP I highly recommend.
    (only in Portuguese, sorry). Another place to Learn I recommend is Laracast. It is beautiful and very good. Some
    courses over there are paid others free, and are good free courses. (only in English, sorry).
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    “But Giovanni! You said you only will read the documentation and now is recommending tutorials? What side you are?”
    I am gonna tell you, for first introduction to something new, is better someone explaing to you and show to you how
    do it and how work, after this first introduction go to the documentation. Will be 10 times easer to understand and
    read some aspects you do not know. Really helps.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    Okay, now you may be asking yourself “how do I know am I stuck on tutorial hell?” I have the answer for
    you. If you need to watch the same video more than two times and do not remember after, go to de documentation. I
    know, time is money, but, sometimes is better go slow.
</p>

<p class="py-2">
    Thank you for everyone to read, have a good day.
